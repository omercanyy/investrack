I have implemented the "Connect to Schwab" feature.

### Changes Made:
1.  **Modified `src/components/Layout.jsx`**:
    *   In the `TopBar` component, I added a new "Connect to Schwab" button that is displayed only when a user is logged in.
    *   This button is styled identically to the "Log Out" button for UI consistency.
    *   I created a new `handleConnectToSchwab` function within the `TopBar` that redirects the user to a placeholder Schwab OAuth URL (`https://api.schwabapi.com/v1/oauth/authorize?client_id=[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]&redirect_uri=[YOUR_REDIRECT_URI]`) when the button is clicked.

### Files Modified:
